# App name

Normally, user tags are applied to tickets, but with this app, you can specify certain ticket tags, and those ticket tags will be applied as user tags to the ticket requester. For example, you want to be able to identify the users who report a certain issue. Create a ticket tag to mark that issue, enter that tag in the app settings, and when a ticket is created or saved with that tag, the requester of the ticket will inherit that tag as well.
